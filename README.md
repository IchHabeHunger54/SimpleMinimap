# Simple Minimap

Simple Minimap is a Minecraft mod for the NeoForge mod loader, adding a minimap and a full-screen map to the game. Its goals are to be fast, user-friendly, easily integrateable with other mods, and completely FOSS (free and open-source software).

The mod was inspired by other map mods that have been popular over the years, most notably Journeymap and Xaero's Minimap. Since both have their set of issues - most notably bloat -, this mod was created with the explicit goal of being an antithesis to that.
